IntelliJ
========

IntelliJ is an **integrated development environment (IDE)**. An IDE is like a text
editor on steroids. It not only allows you to write and edit code, but also contains many 
features that enhance the coding experience. IntelliJ offers
code completion hints, debugging, and even it's own compiler. We'll be using it throughout
this course, so it's time to get familiar with some of the basics.
